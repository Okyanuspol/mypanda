# PANDA
## Sie sind sehr gross aber sher süß
### Die meisten leben in Asia
** The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a species of bear endemic to China.[4] It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.**
